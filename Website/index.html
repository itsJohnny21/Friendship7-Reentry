            <h2>Katherine Johnson and Her Role at NASA</h2>
            <p>Katherine Johnson was the youngest of four, born in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, on August 26, 1918. Her mother was an educator and her father was a farmer. As a young girl, Katherine Johnson loved to learn about everything. From English to mathematics, she always had a deep desire to learn. In fact, because of her passion for learning, she was able to accelerate through school and graduate from high school at an early age. 
                <br><br>
                She later went on to attend West Virginia State College at the age of 15 in pursuit of a degree in mathematics. Of all the things Katherine loved learning, math was her favorite. In fact, she loved math so much that she decided to take every math course that her college provided. The fact that Katherine did this caught one of her professor’s attention. This professor was the remarkable Dr. William W. Schiefflin Claytor. Impressed by Katherine’s brilliant and inquisitive mind, he encouraged her to become a research mathematician and even told her that he would help her become one.
                <br><br>
                After graduating from college at the age of 18, Katherine ended up teaching at a public black school in Marion Virginia. She continued to teach up until she got married and had children with her first husband, James Goble. When her husband became very ill, Katherine returned to teaching in order to support her family.
                <br><br>
                Then in 1952 during a family gathering, a relative mentioned that the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, the predecessor of NASA) was hiring mathematicians. Katherine immediately applied for the position, but unfortunately did not receive any offer. Determined, she applied again the year after and was eventually offered a contract to work for NACA. At the same time, she was offered a contract to teach, leaving her with two options. Remembering what professor Claytor had told her, Katherine took the job at NACA and began work in 1953.
                <br><br>
                Five years later, NACA became what is now known today as NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and the home of the first human space flight project named Project Mercury. Because of Katherine’s expertise in analytic geometry, she was given the role of computing the trajectories for the capsule’s orbit and for its re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, Katherine Johnson was given the task to determine an approximation of the capsule’s splashdown coordinates, a task that is not so easy. At the time, computers were still not fully relied on, meaning that all computations were done by hand. In fact, NASA scientists whose job it was to make computations were given the term ‘computers’. This is what inspired us in modernizing Katherine Johnson’s work with the modern programming language, Python.
