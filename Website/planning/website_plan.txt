The purpose of this website is to inform the reader about the following:
    Katherine Johnson and the role she played during the Mercury Atlas-6 mission
    Our simulated re-entry of Friendship 7
    Our 3D-printed model of Friendship 7's orbit

Goals:
    Capture the reader's attention by showing the simulation first right when the website is loaded
    Educate the reader on Katherine Johnson and the crucial role she played during the Mercury Atlas-6 mission
    Compare and contrast how satellite re-entry was solved back then vs now
    Visualize Katherine Johnson's work using the VPython library and animated graphs
    Compare Euler's method with better numerical methods such as the Runge Kutta methods
    Show the globe we made that simulates the orbit of the Friendship 7 satellite

Sections:
    Intro: How we simulated the re-entry of one of NASA"s capsules
    Katherine Johnson description: Talk about Ketherine Johnson and the role she played during the mission
    The math behind satellite re-entry: Talk about why Euler's method was needed. Explain how the computations were made during the time of the mission
    Modernizing it with code: Talk about how modern programming languages such as Python can automate these computations for us
    Visualizing it with VPython: Talk about visualizing Katherine Johson's with VPython and why it can help understand what Euler's method is about
    Video of Cassy's globe: Talk about how we managed to create a 3D model of the Friendship 7 orbit

Interactive parts:
    Create a play button that will play the re-entry simulation
    Create a play button to play the video of Cassy's globe in action
    Create interactive graphs for the following:
        Newton's method
        Euler's method
        Runge Kutta methods
        Satellite ground track
        Relationship between orbital inclination, launch azimuth, and latitude
